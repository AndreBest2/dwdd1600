        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <h2>Four Friends</h2>
        <p>
            Hermès Haven was born from brotherhood of a creative pact between four friends with different paths but a
            shared obsession for detail, expression, and legacy.

            It all started in 2017, in a cramped apartment in Maryland. Andre Best, the visionary and stylist at heart,
            had been experimenting with repurposing vintage coats and sketching designs on café napkins. With him were
            three longtime friends: Howard Nguyen, the fabric connoisseur and quiet perfectionist; Justin Burton, the
            marketing brain with an eye for the avant garde; and Christopher Jones, a designer who could turn raw ideas
            into tangible statements.

            What began as weekend meetups and late night brainstorms became something bigger: a dream to redefine men’s
            fashion—not with fast trends, but with enduring craftsmanship and soul.
            By 2019, they had pooled their savings to launch their first capsule collection: seven pieces, all handmade,
            sold out of a pop-up studio with nothing but a clothing rack and confidence. The reaction was immediate.
            People didn’t just see fashion they saw identity, culture, and conviction woven into every stitch.
            Today, Hermès Haven stands as a symbol of modern masculinity: bold, refined, and rooted in story.</p>
